# Scripts
Automate my life as much as I can
These scripts are there to automate my work
The monster.py looks at the directory extracts the zip extension, finds the identifier, makes it a folder, and then extracts its contents. There are plenty of comments on that code
Folder.py makes folders for me
Rename.py renames the identifier from monster.py to human/readable names
Extract.py is just extracting the zip files.
